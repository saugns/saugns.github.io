<h2 id='Platforms'>Platforms &amp; modifications</h2>
<p><a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> is mainly developed on
x86/x86-64, because currently, such are the computers used by the
main developer. However, there's no architecture-specific code in
the program, and it reportedly works fine on Raspberry Pi 3, i.e.
ARM. Generally, little-endian 32-bit and 64-bit architectures can
work fine with the current code unless something has been missed.
</p>
<p>For big-endian, not knowing more yet, at a minimum WAV file
output code must change so that output bytes are still little-endian.
</p>
<h3 id='OSes'>Operating systems</h3>
<p>Tested operating systems include the four major BSDs (FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly), and various GNU/Linux distros. *nix,
in general, may be the easiest to further port the program to.
</p>
<p>Written in C99, the program still works on 2010-ish 32-bit x86
DragonFly with GCC 4, and other similarly old *nix systems.
</p>
<h2 id='Re-use'>Re-using smaller parts</h2>
<p>Small parts of saugns, e.g. the oscillator code (for producing
the audio at one "end" of what the program does), low-level "text
file" buffer code (for parsing input at the other "end"), utility
code at the lowest level (for example the mempool), do not depend
on the bigger things which use them, and can be copied for re-use
in other software fairly simply. Note that smaller components are
usually written to fit how saugns uses them, and may turn out too
simple or too specific for other needs.
</p>
<h2 id='Specific'>Specific questions</h2>
<h3 id='Interactive'>Can it be used interactively?</h3>
<p>Currently, no. Unless you count re-running after changing text
as interactive use. There is no interactive prompt, no scheduler,
and no MIDI input support. On the plus side, the program is fast,
you don't have to wait for it to prepare the playing of a script.
</p>
<h3 id='Alternatives'>What main alternatives exist?</h3>
<p>The most well-known among more full-featured alternatives are:
<a href="https://csound.com/">csound</a>, <a href="http://rtcmix.org/">RTcmix</a>, <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>, and <a href="https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that even the most minimalistic of these, ChucK, is much
larger in lines of code than saugns.
