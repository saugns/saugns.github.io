<h2>saugns/SAU language</h2>
<p>SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While developed with the aim of becoming useful for writing
electronic music, the language still has significant limitations,
and the audio generated is retro-ish in its qualities.
It is however easy to use for experimenting with sounds.
</p>
<p>8 basic wave types are supported, as well as AM, FM, and PM
(the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers). An arbitrary number of
oscillators can be used.
</p>
<p>The program reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio) scripts and produces audio.
Output can be to system audio, and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
</p>
<p>Supported platforms include x86 and x86-64,
running DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, or OpenBSD.
</p>
<p>Compared to older and more well-known audio synthesis languages, SAU is simpler (and less developed/full-featured) and more focused on FM/PM. There are differences in basic ideas concerning the language, which will be reflected in further development.
