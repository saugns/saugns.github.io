<h1>saugns &amp; SAU language</h1>
<p><a href='#saugns'>saugns</a> is an audio generation program. Written in C,
it implements the <a href='#SAU'>SAU</a> (Scriptable AUdio) language
&ndash; a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis.

<h2 id='saugns'>saugns program</h2>
<p><i>Command-line usage examples can be found
<a href='usage.html'>here</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>saugns (the Scriptable AUdio GeNeration System) is a
command-line program which reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio)
scripts or strings and produces audio. Output can be to
system audio, and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
</p>
<p>The program is written in C and on the lightweight side,
without any dependencies beyond the standard C library and
support for system audio on the given
<a href='questions.html#Platforms'>platform</a>.
While currently smaller than 100KB once built, it may grow
with the language.
</p>
<p>Mainly tested on x86/x86-64 on *BSD and Linux systems, but
may generally work on 32-bit and 64-bit little-endian systems
for those OSes without the need for changes.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/stable/README">README</a> file (GitHub view) describes how to build and install it.
(Short version: For the 4 major BSDs, `<tt>make</tt>` is enough to get it built.)
</p>
<p>A more interesting test to run after building is the following,
which produces 10 seconds of "engine rumble" using PM:
</p>
<pre>./saugns -e "Osin f137 t10 p+[Osin f32 p+[Osin r(4/3)]]"</pre>
<p>A set of example and test scripts are included,
along with a concise SAU language reference, as described in the README file.
</p>
<h3 id='saugns-licensing'>Licensing</h3>
<p>saugns is distributed under the terms of the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 3</a> or later.
</p>
<p>However, some source files are marked as being more permissively licensed. Mainly, files with various more general utility code or functionality are provided under the BSD-like ISC license.
</p>
<h2 id='SAU'>SAU language</h2>
<p><i>A brief overview of the syntax is available <a href='syntax.html'>here</a>.
A compact language reference is included in the saugns <a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/stable/doc/README.SAU">doc/README.SAU</a> file (GitHub view).</i>
</p>
<p>SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While developed with the aim of becoming useful for writing
electronic music, the language still has significant limitations,
and the audio generated is retro-ish in its qualities.
It is however easy to use for experimenting with sounds.
</p>
<p>A collection of basic wave types are supported, as well as AM/RM,
FM, and PM (the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers). An arbitrary
number of oscillators can be used.
</p>
<p>Compared to older and more well-known audio synthesis languages,
SAU is simpler (and less developed/full-featured) and more focused
on FM/PM. There are differences in basic ideas concerning the language,
which will be reflected in further development.
</p>
<p>The long-term goal is for the syntax both to describe complex sounds
in a simple way, and, especially, for it to make it simple to write
long and intricate sequences of sounds &ndash; music &ndash; both
tersely and in a way easy to mentally map and keep track of. The former
may be the easier part; the latter requires greater expressiveness
than the language has at present.
</p>
<h2 id='project'>Project and plans</h2>
<p><i>The history of the project is briefly described
<a href='history.html'>here</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>At some point in the future, the bulk of the program
could be split off into a C library implementing
support for the SAU language. Such a library could be used
in e.g. media players to play SAU files,
or in retro-ish games to play music or sounds from SAU files.
</p>
<p>Some further ideas are listed on the

<p>I have a mostly software-related
<a href="https://joelkp.frama.io">personal website</a> where I touch on related things.
