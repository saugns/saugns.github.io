<h2>SAU language</h2>
<p>SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While developed with the aim of becoming useful for writing
electronic music, the language still has significant limitations,
and the audio generated is retro-ish in its qualities.
It is however easy to use for experimenting with sounds.
</p>
<p>8 basic wave types are supported, as well as AM, FM, and PM
(the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers). An arbitrary number of
oscillators can be used.
</p>
<p>Compared to older and more well-known audio synthesis languages,
SAU is simpler (and less developed/full-featured) and more focused
on FM/PM. There are differences in basic ideas concerning the language,
which will be reflected in further development.
</p>
<p>The long-term goal is for the syntax both to describe complex sounds
in a simple way, and, especially, for it to make it simple to write
long and intricate sequences of sounds &ndash; music &ndash; both
tersely and in a way easy to mentally map and keep track of. The former
may be the easier part; the latter requires greater expressiveness
than the language has at present.
</p>
<p>A compact language reference is included in the saugns README file.
</p>
<h2>saugns program</h2>
<p>saugns is a command-line program which reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio)
scripts and produces audio. Output can be to system audio,
and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
</p>
<p>Supported platforms include x86 and x86-64,
running DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, or OpenBSD.
</p>
<p>The program is deliberately minimalistic and without any dependencies
beyond the standard C library and support for system audio on the given
platform. While currently smaller than 100KB once built, it may grow
with the language.
