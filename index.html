<h1>saugns &amp; SAU language</h1>
<p><a href='#saugns'>saugns</a> is an audio generation program. Written in C,
it implements the SAU (Scriptable AUdio) language.
<a href='#SAU'>SAU</a> is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis.

<h2 id='saugns'>saugns program</h2>
<p>saugns (the Scriptable AUdio GeNeration System) is a
command-line program which reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio)
scripts or strings and produces audio. Output can be to
system audio, and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
</p>
<p>The program is written in C and on the lightweight side,
without any dependencies beyond the standard C library and
support for system audio on the given platform. While
currently smaller than 100KB once built, it may grow
with the language.
</p>
<p>saugns is distributed under the terms of the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-4.0.en.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 3</a> or later.
</p>
<p>Supported platforms include x86 and x86-64,
running DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, or OpenBSD.
</p>
<p>Building requires a C99 compiler and `make` (GNU or BSD).
On Linux systems, the ALSA library (<tt>libasound2</tt>) needs to be installed.
On the 4 major BSDs, the base systems have everything needed.
</p>
<p>A quick test after building is the following, which should beep a sine wave for 1 second:
</p>
<pre>./saugns -e "Osin"</pre>
<p>Or, for something more interesting, the following produces 10 seconds of "engine rumble" using PM:
</p>
<pre>./saugns -e "Osin f137 t10 p+[Osin f32 p+[Osin f42]]"</pre>
<p>A set of example and test scripts are also included, under <tt>examples/</tt>.
(These are copied to a <tt>share/saugns/</tt> directory with `make install`.)
</p>
<h3>Plans</h3>
<p>The bulk of the program may be split off into a library implementing
support for the SAU language in the future.
</p>
<p>Such a library could be used in e.g. media players to play SAU files,
or in retro-ish games to play music or sounds from SAU files.
</p>
<p>Further ideas are listed on the <a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns/wiki">saugns GitHub wiki</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='SAU'>SAU language</h2>
<p>SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While developed with the aim of becoming useful for writing
electronic music, the language still has significant limitations,
and the audio generated is retro-ish in its qualities.
It is however easy to use for experimenting with sounds.
</p>
<p>8 basic wave types are supported, as well as AM, FM, and PM
(the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers). An arbitrary number of
oscillators can be used.
</p>
<p>A brief overview of the syntax is available <a href='syntax.html'>here</a>.
A compact language reference is included in the saugns <a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/master/README'>README file</a> (GitHub view).
</p>
<p>Compared to older and more well-known audio synthesis languages,
SAU is simpler (and less developed/full-featured) and more focused
on FM/PM. There are differences in basic ideas concerning the language,
which will be reflected in further development.
</p>
<p>The long-term goal is for the syntax both to describe complex sounds
in a simple way, and, especially, for it to make it simple to write
long and intricate sequences of sounds &ndash; music &ndash; both
tersely and in a way easy to mentally map and keep track of. The former
may be the easier part; the latter requires greater expressiveness
than the language has at present.
