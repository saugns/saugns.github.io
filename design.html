<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Notes on the design of the <a href='index.html'>saugns software (and SAU language)</a>, as it has evolved. (The SAU language has evolved in parallel with the software implementing it.)

<h2 id='roots'>Roots: Early 2011 design</h2>
<p>The program was developed from scratch, the language starting out as something simple enough for a trivial program to interpret.
</p>
<p>If a single big letter is used to start an oscillator, and a small letter followed by a number gives it a value for frequency ('f'), amplitude ('a'), or time duration ('t'), then parsing is trivial. No abstractions for lexing or syntax trees, etc., are necessary. Oscillator by oscillator, the parser can simply add a node to a list for the generator to run after parsing, setting values for the current node according to any parameter assignments in the script.
</p>
<p>The big eventual problem is that the complexity of keeping it working explodes exponentially as features for greater expressiveness are added to the language. But long before that point is reached, in small and tidy ways it's very possible to support nice things like parallel audio generation, combined with a sequential "time separator", and a more flexible "insert time delay for what's placed after this" modifier.
</p>
<p>Supporting nested lists in the parser and generator allows implementing modulation techniques, with the language extended to allow a list of oscillators to do something with frequency, phase, amplitude, etc. A touch of recursion, and this is a simple-enough extension.
</p>
<p>That kind of terse and simple language which a fairly trivial program can run may be ideal for a flexible tone generator language. But there's a great, huge chasm between that and a powerful musical language.
