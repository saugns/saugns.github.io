<h1>Usage of the saugns program</h1>
<p>Usage examples for the
<a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> program,
and some further notes. For the script language SAU,
see the <a href='language.html'>language</a> page, or
the <a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/stable/doc/README.SAU'>doc/README.SAU</a> file (GitHub view).
</p>
<p>Running the program with no arguments, or with <code>-h</code>,
prints a concise list of arguments and invocation types supported.
The same information, and a bit more, is provided with the accompanying
<code>saugns(1)</code> man page.

<h2 id='playing'>Playing scripts or strings</h2>
<p>To simply play a script, using the default sample rate (96000 Hz):
</p>
<pre>saugns script</pre>
<p>(Several filenames can be listed, or a <code>*</code> glob pattern used,
to play several files one after the other.)
</p>
<p>To play a one-liner (in this example,
sweeping through the human hearing range in 10 seconds):
</p>
<pre>saugns -e "Osin f20 f{v20000 cexp} t10 a0.25"</pre>
<p>(Several string arguments can be listed when <code>-e</code> is used,
each of which plays as a separate script.)
</p>
<p>Sample rate in Hz can be changed using the <code>-r</code> option:
</p>
<pre>saugns -r 48000 script(s)</pre>
<h3 id='AUDIODEV'>Changing audio device</h3>
<p>The option of which audio device name or path is used (for ALSA, OSS, etc.) by saugns can be changed by setting the <code>AUDIODEV</code>
environment variable, similarly to how other software supports this option:
</p>
<pre>export AUDIODEV=value</pre>
<p>...where instead of <code>value</code> something is inserted to
replace e.g. <code>default</code> for ALSA or sndio, or <code>/dev/dsp</code> for OSS.
</p>
<p>See the man page for notes on compatibility support for differently named environment variables specific to one or another system standard.
</p>
<h2 id='checking'>Checking scripts</h2>
<p>To simply check if scripts parse cleanly (no errors or warnings),
use the <code>-c</code> option:
</p>
<pre>saugns -c examples/*.sau examples/*/*.sau</pre>
<p>To print info for scripts based on a parse
(duration, number of voices, and a partial
debug info listing of what the script does):
</p>
<pre>saugns -cp script(s)</pre>
<p>(The <code>-c</code> can be left out to also play.)
</p>
<h2 id='writing'>Writing audio files</h2>
<p>To write a 16-bit stereo PCM WAV file
named "a.wav" containing all of the audio from script(s):
</p>
<pre>saugns -o a.wav script(s)</pre>
<p>By default, writing a file makes the program run silent instead of playing scripts. This can be changed by adding the <code>-a</code> (audible) option, to also produce output for system audio.
</p>
<p>Note that the default sample rate is 96000 Hz. It can be changed by using the <code>-r</code> option, as in the following example which uses CD quality sample rate. Note however that if you want to minimize aliasing distortion for sounds with too-wide frequency spectrums, it's best to instead write a WAV file with a higher sample rate and then use a separate tool to downsample with quality if you want a lower final sample rate.
</p>
<pre>saugns -r 44100 -o a.wav script(s)</pre>
<p>If you need further format conversion or editing of WAV files,
other tools will be needed. For example,
<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage">SoX</a> and
<a href="http://www.eca.cx/ecasound/index.php">Ecasound</a> are
capable command-line tools (unrelated to this project).
</p>
<h2 id='shebang'>Files with shebangs</h2>
<p>As with shell scripts and various other types of scripts, a Unix shebang can be used for SAU scripts. Placing <code>#!</code> at the very beginning of a script, followed by the full path to the installed saugns binary, makes the file run using saugns when the file is used by itself as if it were a program. This also requires the script file to have the execute permission set (as in <code>chmod +x filename</code>).
</p>
<p>This is generally most useful for creating sound-playing files &ndash; and saugns gets going producing audio very fast when such a file is launched. The shebang line on top can optionally include e.g. a specific playback sample rate to use for the script, as it does in the following example (where 48000 Hz is set).
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/saugns -r48000
</pre>
<p>Of course, other arguments could be included after the path to saugns to instead make the script do something like (also) print info about itself, or write to some WAV file path included in the shebang line.
