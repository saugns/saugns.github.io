<h1>SAU language syntax</h1>
<p>A brief, informal overview of the syntax of the SAU language provided by the <a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> program. It does not cover everything.
A more systematic, concise reference can be found in the <a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/master/README'>README file</a> (GitHub view).
</p>
<h2 id='output'>Generating sound</h2>
<p>To generate a single pure tone in the SAU language:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5 t1</pre>
<p>In this case, frequency is set to 440 Hz, phase to 0% of the wave cycle,
and amplitude to 0.5 (-6dB). The time duration will be 1 second.
</p>
<p>The "<tt>O</tt>" adds an oscillator (also called an "operator" in FM synth
terminology). It is followed by a wave type value, in this case "<tt>sin</tt>"
(there's also "<tt>tri</tt>", "<tt>sqr</tt>", "<tt>saw</tt>", and more).
The other parameters are named, but not ordered, and any which are left out
will be given default values. (All of them could be left out,
for the shortest script which generates audio: "<tt>Osin</tt>".)
</p>
<p>To generate a cosine, use the "<tt>sin</tt>" wave type and set phase to 25% of the wave cycle with "<tt>p0.25</tt>".
</p>
<p>Oscillators can be used in a nested way,
as in this example which uses PM (phase modulation):
</p>
<pre>
// Generate 10 seconds of "engine rumble"
Osin f137 t10 p+[
	Osin f32 p+[
		Osin f42
	]
]
</pre>
<p>The oscillators with frequency 32 Hz and 42 Hz are linked in a chain
which ends at the carrier (with frequency 137 Hz), and play when it does.
The "<tt>p+</tt>" means "add to the phase", which is what PM does.
</p>
<h3>Compared to SuperCollider</h3>
<p>This example for <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>
generates a sine wave (without actually playing it,
which requires a few additional details):
</p>
<pre>SinOsc.ar(440, 0, 0.5);</pre>
<p>In SAU, the closest-looking equivalent is:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5</pre>
<p>By itself, this is a carrier oscillator which will play for
the default time of 1 second. It could also be included in
a list of modulators, and will then be linked to a carrier
and play when the carrier does.
</p>
<p>In SAU, data cannot currently be held or combined without
specifying carrier oscillators which play.
</p>
<h2 id='numexp'>Numerical expressions</h2>
<p>Numbers can be specified with or without a decimal point.
Within parentheses, signs ("<tt>+</tt>" or "<tt>-</tt>"),
and arithmetic operators ("<tt>+</tt>", "<tt>-</tt>",
"<tt>*</tt>", "<tt>/</tt>", and "<tt>^</tt>") are allowed
&ndash; with whitespace freely placed.
Note that negative numbers require parentheses around them,
to enclose the sign.
</p>
<p>If a decimal point is used,
a leading "<tt>0</tt>" can be left out
&ndash; as in "<tt>.25</tt>".
