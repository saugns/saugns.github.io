<h1>SAU language syntax</h1>
<p>A brief overview of how to use the syntax of the SAU language
provided by the <a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> program.
It is meant to make things simple rather than cover everything.
(For usage examples for the command-line program,
see the <a href='usage.html'>usage</a> page.)
</p>
<p>A concise language reference (as in listing of details) can
be found in the <a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/stable/doc/README.SAU'>doc/README.SAU</a> file (GitHub view).

<h2 id='output'>Generating sound</h2>
<p>To generate a single pure tone in the SAU language:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5 t1</pre>
<p>In this case, frequency is set to 440 Hz, phase to 0% of the wave cycle,
and amplitude to 0.5 (-6dB). The time duration will be 1 second.
</p>
<p>The <code>O</code> adds an oscillator (also called an "operator" in FM synth
terminology). It is followed by a wave type value, in this case <code>sin</code>
(there's also <code>tri</code>, <code>sqr</code>, <code>saw</code>, and more).
The other parameters are named, but not ordered, and any which are left out
will be given default values. (All of them could be left out,
for the shortest script which generates audio: <code>Osin</code>
beeps for 1 second.)
</p>
<p>A cosine can be generated using the <code>sin</code> wave type,
by setting phase to 25% of the wave cycle,
using <code>p(1/4)</code> or <code>p0.25</code>.
</p>
<h3 id='modulation'>Using modulation</h3>
<p>Oscillators can be used in a nested way,
as in this example which uses PM (phase modulation):
</p>
<pre>
// Generate 10 seconds of "engine rumble"
Osin f137 t10 p+[
	Osin f32 p+[
		Osin f42
	]
]
</pre>
<p>The oscillators with frequency 32 Hz and 42 Hz are modulators,
linked in a chain which ends at the carrier (with frequency 137 Hz),
and play for the same time (10 seconds).
Modulators only run when their carriers do;
their default time durations, unlike for carriers,
is actually infinite, which means playing as long as the carrier does.
(The <code>p+</code> means "add to the phase",
and PM means adding modulator amplitudes to the phase.)
</p>
<p>For modulators, frequency can be specified using <code>r</code>
(<i>relative frequency</i>) instead of <code>f</code>.
The value assigned to <code>r</code> will be multiplied by
the carrier frequency in order to give the frequency of
the modulator. For example, a modulator with <code>r(4/3)</code>
will maintain a frequency 4/3 times the frequency of the carrier;
changing the <code>f42</code> in the example above to that gives
a somewhat different sound.
</p>
<p>Frequency and amplitude can be given values which are computed
using oscillator outputs shifted to a range. See the section
<a href='#modvalrange'>Modulation with value range</a>.
</p>
<h3 id='timing'>Timing</h3>
<p>A <code>|</code> separates that before and that after in time,
while <code>\</code> (followed by a time in seconds)
adds delay independently of that.
</p>
<p>To generate two tones, separated in time,
and also insert an extra 2.5 seconds of silence in-between them:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f440 t2
|\2.5

Osin f220 t2
</pre>
<p>To change the frequency for an oscillator
after inserting a 1 second delay:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f440 t2 \1 f220
</pre>
<p>Parameters for an oscillator can also be changed
after a time duration without affecting surrounding timing,
adding a new time duration for which the new values apply.
This uses the <code>;</code> separator:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f440 t1
; f220 t1
</pre>
<p>This can also be done for an oscillator within a list.
</p>
<h2 id='values'>Values and expressions</h2>
<p>For most parameters, a single number is a value.
The number may be written simply, or as an <a href='#numexp'>expression</a>
which is evaluated to yield the number. A simple number can be written with
or without a decimal point. Negative numbers require the use of parentheses,
so as to enclose the minus (<code>-</code>) sign, as in <code>(-0.5)</code>.
</p>
<p>Other types of values also exist. Parameters for amplitude, frequency,
and panning support using <a href='#ramp'>value ramp</a> values for timed
"ramping" or "sweeping" instead of the instantaneous setting of a value.
</p>
<p>Frequency and amplitude parameters support yet another type of value,
for FM or AM/RM <a href='#modvalrange'>with a value range</a>, respectively.
</p>
<p>All types of modulation use the <i>list</i> of oscillators as a type
of parameter value, supported in a nested way.
</p>
<p><a href='#comment'>Comments</a> are text which is ignored;
several comment styles are supported.
</p>
<h3 id='numexp'>Numerical expressions</h3>
<p>Each number can be written with or without a decimal point.
If a decimal point is used, a leading <code>0</code> can be left out,
as in <code>.25</code>.
</p>
<p>Within parentheses, arithmetic operations
in ordinary infix notation can be used, giving a number as a result.
For example, <code>(1/2)</code> is another way of writing <code>0.5</code>.
Plus or minus signs (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>)
can only be added to numbers within parentheses, so
negative numbers requires parentheses to be used, e.g. <code>(-1)</code>.
Supported arithmetic operations are:
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>,
and <code>^</code> (to the power of).
Conventional rules determine precedence
when not made explicitly clear using parentheses.
Nested parentheses can also be used for multiplication in the customary way,
e.g. <code>(2(3))</code> means <code>6</code>.
</p>
<p>Some parameters support named constants specific to that type
of value. For such a value, a constant name can be written
in place of a number.
</p>
<p>A set of mathematical functions are also supported in expressions for
all parameters, whether or not surrounding parentheses are used.
Instead of writing a number, <code>name(number)</code> gives the result
for the number using the function <code>name</code>. Functions include <code>exp</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, and a few others. A musically interesting function for frequency ratios and some other uses may be <code>met</code>, which produces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_mean">metallic means/ratios/constants</a> (the Wikipedia article has the formula used); for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a> value of 1.618... is the result of <code>met(1)</code>, and a modulator oscillator can have its <code>r</code> parameter set to that with <code>rmet(1)</code>. (The function can take any value, producing "metallic values" between the "proper" ones for the integers. Negative values also give how much the positive would be increased, less further from zero. Furthermore, met(-x) is equal to (1/met(x)).)
</p>
<h3 id='comment'>Comment syntax</h3>
<p>Several comment styles exist:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>//</code> (C++-style comment) comments out the rest of a line.</li>
<li><code>/*</code> (C-style comment) comments out text until the next <code>*/</code>. Does not nest.</li>
<li><code>#!</code> (Shebang) comments out the rest of a line.</li>
<li><code>#Q</code> (Quit file) comments out the rest of the whole file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id='labelref'>Labels and referencing</h3>
<p>The declaration of an oscillator/operator can be
prefixed by <code>'label </code>, where <code>label</code> is a
case-sensitive alphanumeric name. (Underscores can also be used.)
That which is labeled can be referred to
using the syntax <code>@label</code>, to place
changes to it in any time scope later in the script.
</p>
<p>Note that a <code>@label</code> reference placed in a nesting scope
different from the original does not add the operator to the new
nesting scope. (It will not be moved out from nor into a list by
being referenced anywhere.) The time scope is however new and of
the reference.
</p>
<p>For example, the modulator used in this PM example has its frequency
relative to the carrier changed at one-second intervals:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f500 t5 p+[
	'name Osin r(1/1)
]

\1
@name r(1/2)
\1
@name r(1/3)
\1
@name r(1/4)
\1
@name r(1/5)
</pre>
<p>A shorter alternative for the second half is this:</p>
<pre>
\1
@name r(1/2) \1 r(1/3) \1 r(1/4) \1 r(1/5)
</pre>
<p>The section <a href='#timing'>Timing</a> describes more means of
placing changes in time. The <code>;</code> separator is often a simpler
alternative, but can also be combined with label referencing:
</p>
<pre>
\1
@name r(1/2) t1
; r(1/3) t1
; r(1/4) t1
; r(1/5)
</pre>
<h3 id='ramp'>Value ramps</h3>
<p>To ramp, or "sweep", a parameter value towards a goal,
a set of value ramp arguments can be given instead of the usual number.
(This is currently supported for amplitude, frequency, and panning parameters.)
The usual number is used as the starting value for the trajectory,
and the parameter can be assigned a value twice in order to provide both.
</p>
<p>The ramp sub-parameters are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>v</code> (Target value.)</li>
<li><code>t</code> (Time to reach target value. Defaults to time of oscillator.)</li>
<li><code>c</code> (Curve type:
	<code>hold</code>, <code>lin</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>log</code>,
	<code>xpe</code>, <code>lge</code>, or <code>cos</code>.
	Defaults to <code>lin</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following tone begins at 20 Hz
and rises exponentially to 20000 Hz, over 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre>Osin f20 f{v20000 cexp} t10 a0.25</pre>
<p>The exponential and logarithmic curves are
polynomial approximations with definite beginnings and ends,
rather than real exponential and logarithmic curves.
(The <code>log</code> curve also skips the below-zero part
of a real logarithmic curve, i.e. it really approximates
the mathematical function <tt>log(1 + x)</tt>.)
These approximations have been tuned by ear to sound "smooth" and natural.
</p>
<p>The <code>xpe</code> curve exponentially saturates and decays,
like a capacitor &ndash; this means an upside-down decay for the increase
(it increases like the <code>log</code> curve and
decreases like the <code>exp</code> curve).
This is natural-sounding behavior for envelope-like use.
The <code>lge</code> curve behaves the opposite,
logarithmically saturating and decaying
(increasing like <code>exp</code> and decreasing like <code>log</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>cos</code> curve rises or falls like a cosine wave, generally percevied to be fairly similar to a linear increase or decrease. The change has a smoothly curved start and stop, and a steeper middle.
</p>
<h3 id='modvalrange'>Modulation with value range</h3>
<p>Amplitude and frequency (and relative frequency) parameters support
modulation of the parameter values within a bounded value range.
(For amplitude, whether this modulation is called amplitude
modulation (AM) or ring modulation (RM) is a matter of the value
range. Ring modulation has the same magnitude for the upper and
lower bound, but with differing sign, while classic amplitude
modulation has one of the bounds set to zero. The term AM has been used
more generally for the full range of variation in the software, but for
clarity it's best to note that classic AM and RM are both special cases.)
</p>
<p>The two bounds of the value range come from the two (!) values of the
parameter, the normal value generally used, and a second value which is
only used for this type of modulation and which defaults to 0.0.
</p>
<p>A simple FM example:
</p>
<pre>
// Vary frequency between 250 Hz and 500 Hz, using a 0.1 Hz sine wave
Osin f250,500~[Osin f0.1] t10
</pre>
<p>A simple AM example:
</p>
<pre>
// Vary amplitude between 1/4 and full, using a half-wave with 1/5 frequency
Osin f200 a(1/4),(4/4)~[Ohrs r(1/5)] t5
</pre>
<p>The second value can also be set without changing the first value
for the parameter, by writing nothing before the comma separating them.
</p>
<p>After value(s) or by itself, <code>~[]</code> (tilde and square brackets)
can be used to set a list of modulator operators specified within the
<code>[]</code>; the list replaces any previous modulators set, and may be empty.
</p>
<p>Each modulator in the list will produce a result in the range
of 0.0 to 1.0, i.e. a positive signal, multiplied by its amplitude
parameter (defaulting to 1.0), negative amplitude multipliers having
the effect of switching the top and bottom of the 0.0 to 1.0 range.
</p>
<p>The product of modulator amplitudes is mapped to the value
range; 0.0 means the normal value and 1.0 means the second value.
Setting (changing) the amplitude for modulators will thus change
the range when the absolute value is not 1.0, but this is allowed
for the sake of flexibility.
</p>
<h2 id='supercollider'>Compared to SuperCollider</h2>
<p>SAU is simple and lacks many features,
while <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a> is a main
example of a language and system providing everything and the kitchen sink
with a more conventional-looking language syntax.
</p>
<p>In SAU, data cannot currently be held or combined without
specifying carrier oscillators which play. While some simple
things are simpler in SAU (including playing with modulation
types), expressiveness drops beyond doing individual sounds.
</p>
<p>In SuperCollider, a most basic thing, generating a sine wave, looks as follows. Note that it doesn't actually play it, which requires a few additional details.
</p>
<pre>SinOsc.ar(440, 0, 0.5);</pre>
<p>In SAU, the closest-looking equivalent is:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5</pre>
<p>By itself, this is a carrier oscillator which will play for
the default time of 1 second. It could also be included in
a list of modulators, and will then be linked to a carrier
and play when the carrier does.
