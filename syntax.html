<h1>SAU language syntax</h1>
<p>A brief overview of how to use the syntax of the SAU language
provided by the <a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> program.
It does not cover everything.
A systematic, concise reference can be found in the <a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns/blob/master/README'>README file</a> (GitHub view).
(For usage of the command-line program,
see the <a href='usage.html'>usage</a> page.)
</p>
<p>Note that this describes the version provided by the git
<a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns'>master branch</a>
(what you get with a `git clone https://github.com/saugns/saugns.git`).
</p>
<h2 id='output'>Generating sound</h2>
<p>To generate a single pure tone in the SAU language:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5 t1</pre>
<p>In this case, frequency is set to 440 Hz, phase to 0% of the wave cycle,
and amplitude to 0.5 (-6dB). The time duration will be 1 second.
</p>
<p>The "<tt>O</tt>" adds an oscillator (also called an "operator" in FM synth
terminology). It is followed by a wave type value, in this case "<tt>sin</tt>"
(there's also "<tt>tri</tt>", "<tt>sqr</tt>", "<tt>saw</tt>", and more).
The other parameters are named, but not ordered, and any which are left out
will be given default values. (All of them could be left out,
for the shortest script which generates audio: "<tt>Osin</tt>"
beeps for 1 second.)
</p>
<p>A cosine can be generated using the "<tt>sin</tt>" wave type,
by setting phase to 25% of the wave cycle,
using "<tt>p(1/4)</tt>" or "<tt>p0.25</tt>".
</p>
<h3>Using modulation</h3>
<p>Oscillators can be used in a nested way,
as in this example which uses PM (phase modulation):
</p>
<pre>
// Generate 10 seconds of "engine rumble"
Osin f137 t10 p+[
	Osin f32 p+[
		Osin f42
	]
]
</pre>
<p>The oscillators with frequency 32 Hz and 42 Hz are modulators,
linked in a chain which ends at the carrier (with frequency 137 Hz),
and play for the same time (10 seconds).
Modulators only run when their carriers do;
their default time durations, unlike for carriers,
is actually infinite, which means playing as long as the carrier does.
(The "<tt>p+</tt>" means "add to the phase",
and PM means adding modulator amplitudes to the phase.)
</p>
<p>For modulators, frequency can be specified using '<tt>r</tt>'
(<i>relative frequency</i>) instead of '<tt>f</tt>'.
The value assigned to '<tt>r</tt>' will be multiplied by
the carrier frequency in order to give the frequency of
the modulator. For example, a modulator with "<tt>r(2/3)</tt>"
will maintain a frequency 2/3 times the frequency of the carrier.
</p>
<p>Frequency and amplitude can be given values which are computed
using FM or AM, respectively. See the section
<a href='#modvalrange'>Modulation with value range</a>.
</p>
<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>A "<tt>|</tt>" separates that before and that after in time,
while "<tt>\</tt>" (followed by a time in seconds)
adds delay independently of that.
</p>
<p>To generate two tones, separated in time,
and also insert an extra 2.5 seconds of silence in-between them:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f440 t2
|\2.5

Osin f220 t2
</pre>
<p>Parameters for an oscillator can also be changed
after a time duration without affecting surrounding timing,
adding a new time duration for which the new values apply.
This uses the "<tt>;</tt>" separator:
</p>
<pre>
Osin f440 t1
; f220 t1
</pre>
<p>This can also be done for an oscillator within a list.
</p>
<h3>Compared to SuperCollider</h3>
<p>This example for <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>
generates a sine wave (without actually playing it,
which requires a few additional details):
</p>
<pre>SinOsc.ar(440, 0, 0.5);</pre>
<p>In SAU, the closest-looking equivalent is:
</p>
<pre>Osin f440 p0 a0.5</pre>
<p>By itself, this is a carrier oscillator which will play for
the default time of 1 second. It could also be included in
a list of modulators, and will then be linked to a carrier
and play when the carrier does.
</p>
<p>In SAU, data cannot currently be held or combined without
specifying carrier oscillators which play.
</p>
<h2 id='values'>Values and expressions</h2>
<p>For most parameters, a single number is a value.
The number may be written simply, or as an <a href='#numexp'>expression</a>
which is evaluated to yield the number. A simple number can be written with
or without a decimal point. Negative numbers require the use of parentheses,
so as to enclose the minus (<tt>-</tt>) sign, as in "<tt>(-0.5)</tt>".
</p>
<p>Other types of values also exist. Parameters for amplitude, frequency,
and panning support using <a href='#ramp'>value ramp</a> values for timed
"ramping" or "sweeping" instead of the instantaneous setting of a value.
</p>
<p>Frequency and amplitude parameters support yet another type of value,
for FM or AM <a href='#modvalrange'>with a value range</a>, respectively.
</p>
<p>All types of modulation use the <i>list</i> of oscillators as a type
of parameter value, supported in a nested way.
</p>
<p><a href='#comment'>Comments</a> are text which is ignored;
several comment styles are supported.
</p>
<h3 id='numexp'>Numerical expressions</h3>
<p>Within parentheses, numbers can be combined with arithmetic operators.
The result is treated as a number. For example, "<tt>(1/2)</tt>"
is another way of writing "<tt>0.5</tt>".
Plus or minus signs (<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>) can only be added to numbers
within parentheses. (Negative numbers require the use of parentheses.)
</p>
<p>Individual numbers can be specified with or without a decimal point.
If a decimal point is used, a leading "<tt>0</tt>" can be left out
&ndash; as in "<tt>.25</tt>".
</p>
<p>Supported arithmetic operators are:
<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>,
and <tt>^</tt> (to the power of).
Conventional rules determine precedence
when not made clear using parentheses.
Nested parentheses can be used for multiplication in the customary way,
e.g. "<tt>(2(3))</tt>" means "<tt>6</tt>".
</p>
<h3 id='ramp'>Value ramp</h3>
<p>To ramp, or "sweep", a parameter value towards a goal,
a set of value ramp arguments can be given instead of the usual number.
(This is currently supported for amplitude, frequency, and panning parameters.)
The usual number is used as the starting value for the trajectory,
and the parameter can be assigned a value twice in order to provide both.
</p>
<p>The ramp sub-parameters are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>v</tt> (Target value.)</li>
<li><tt>t</tt> (Time to reach target value. Defaults to time of oscillator.)</li>
<li><tt>c</tt> (Curve type:
	'<tt>hold</tt>', '<tt>lin</tt>', '<tt>exp</tt>', '<tt>log</tt>',
	'<tt>esd</tt>', or '<tt>lsd</tt>'.
	Defaults to '<tt>lin</tt>'.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following tone begins at 20 Hz
and rises exponentially to 20000 Hz, over 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre>Osin f20 f{v20000 cexp} t10 a0.25</pre>
<p>The exponential and logarithmic curves are
polynomial approximations with definite beginnings and ends,
rather than real exponential and logarithmic curves.
(The '<tt>log</tt>' curve also skips the below-zero part
of a real logarithmic curve, i.e. it really approximates
the mathematical function "log(1 + x)".)
These approximations have been tuned by ear to sound "smooth" and natural.
</p>
<p>The '<tt>esd</tt>' curve exponentially saturates and decays,
like a capacitor &ndash; this means an upside-down decay for the increase
(it increases like the '<tt>log</tt>' curve and
decreases like the '<tt>exp</tt>' curve).
This is natural-sounding behavior for envelope-like use.
The '<tt>lsd</tt>' curve behaves the opposite,
logarithmically saturating and decaying
(increasing like '<tt>exp</tt>' and decreasing like '<tt>log</tt>').

</p>
<p>Following "<tt>/*</tt>", text is
commented out until "<tt>*/</tt>" has been read.

<p>Following "<tt>#</tt>", the rest of a line is commented out.
Note that this may change in future versions;
"<tt>#</tt>" may be given a more complex meaning.
</p>
<p>A "<tt>Q</tt>", by itself,
