<h1>History</h1>
<p>Brief history of the
<a href='index.html'>saugns program, SAU language</a> and project as a whole.
</p>
<h2>2011&ndash;2012</h2>
<p>The program was originally developed in 2011-2012. Meant to
have a "retro"-touch from the start, it was originally inspired
by the "sound" of the 16-bit video game era, particularly
Sega Genesis games and the FM synth side of the samples vs. FM divide.
</p>
<p>The design unfolded bottom-up, experimentally, into something very
compact and simple - which also applies to the scripting language.
But it became clear that much, much work would be needed to make it
truly suitable for writing music in, as opposed to merely experimenting
with sounds. Far greater expressiveness was hoped for than was
straightforward to arrive at.
</p>
<p>Various sketchy ideas for further development remain from this period.
</p>
<p>The program was first called "mgensys" and then renamed "sgensys".
Two sgensys versions were released in 2012 at Gna!, with OSS
system audio support and WAV file output support. Historical
versions are available in the
<a href='https://github.com/saugns/saugns'>modern git repository</a>.
</p>
<p>These historical versions never had any known users other
than the original developer.
</p>
<h2>2013&ndash;2014</h2>
<p>The project stagnated after a time of mostly theoretical focus.
Old notes concerning possible future work had accumulated, with far
more held in mind than written down concerning the subtle issues
and limitations of different design chocies.
</p>
<p>In 2013, Linux ALSA support was added to the old program,
and some quick experimentations with redesigns in mind remain
from that year and 2014.
</p>
<p>Two 2014 snapshots in the version history capture the
sketchy outline of a lexer (meant to go along with a new
language with an undecided syntax), and before that,
incomplete ideas for a more intermediate redesign of the old system.
</p>
<p>The old program design and language were seen as a dead end,
but no substantial ideas for a rewrite developed.
</p>
<h2>2017&ndash;2019</h2>
<p>The project was revived in Nov. 2017, with a mix of clean-up work
and some experimentation.
</p>
<p>A year later, the code was cleaner and more portable,
but features largely the same.
</p>
<p>In Jan. 2019, the project and program was renamed to saugns
and the language to SAU (Scriptable AUdio).
</p>
<p><b>v0.3.0</b>, released in July 2019, completed the basic clean-up work.
The biggest single design change is in the scanning and parsing, new
low-level code having been spun off from the 2014 test lexer.
Command-line options are expanded and strings can be evaluated with "-e".
Various syntax details have been tweaked (without changing basic capabilities).
</p>
<p>Other notable improvements include better audio mixing,
3 added wave types, changes and additions to value ramp curves,
and automatic downscaling of amplitude by the number of voices
(easily added as voices were already counted).
</p>
<p>Further <b>v0.3.x</b> versions continue to tweak and refine
the syntax and program, without greatly changing audio generation
capabilities. New major audio features are planned to go in v0.4.x
and later, though preparatory and other redesign work may enter earlier.
</p>
<p>The future of the project is at a cross-roads. How it may change or
expand, and in what order things may end up being worked on, is uncertain.
Some ideas are listed on the

Discussion and feedback is welcome.
