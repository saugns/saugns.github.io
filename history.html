<h1>History</h1>
<p>Brief history of the

<h2 id='2011'>2011&ndash;2012</h2>
<p>The program was originally developed in 2011-2012. Meant to
have a "retro"-touch from the start, it was originally inspired
by the "sound" of the 16-bit video game era, particularly
Sega Genesis games and the FM synth side of the samples vs. FM divide.
</p>
<p>The design unfolded bottom-up, experimentally, into something very
compact and simple &ndash; which also applies to the scripting language.
But after a few months, and in large part arriving at
<a href='design.html#roots'>the early design</a>,
it became clearer over time that much work would be needed to make it
truly suitable for writing music in. It had only become fit for
experimenting with sound. Far greater expressiveness was hoped
for than was straightforward to arrive at.
</p>
<p>In hindsight, many changes were rushed or poorly done after
the initial design was arrived at. The first four months or so
brought most things of more lasting quality. The remaining ten
were spent breaking and unbreaking things in various ways, and
leaving extra debugging and clean-up work for later years.
</p>
<p>The program was first called "mgensys" and then renamed "sgensys".
Two sgensys versions were released in 2012 at Gna!, with OSS
system audio support and WAV file output support. Historical
versions, including other old snapshots, precede modern work in the
<a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns">git repository</a>.
</p>
<p>These historical versions never had any known users other
than the original developer.
</p>
<p>Various sketchy ideas for further development
<a href='ideas2012.html'>remain</a> from this period.
</p>
<h2 id='2013'>2013&ndash;2014</h2>
<p>The project stagnated after a time of mostly theoretical focus.
<a href='ideas2012.html'>Old notes</a> on possible future work had
accumulated, with far more held in mind than written down about
the subtle issues and limitations of different design choices.
</p>
<p>In 2013, Linux ALSA support was added to the old program,
and some quick experimentation with redesigns in mind remain
from that year and 2014.
</p>
<p>Two 2014 snapshots in the version history capture the
sketchy outline of a lexer (meant to go along with a new
language with an undecided syntax), and before that,
incomplete ideas for an intermediate redesign of the old system.
</p>
<p>The old program design and language were seen as a dead end,
but no substantial ideas for a rewrite developed.
</p>
<h2 id='2017'>2017&ndash;2019</h2>
<p>The project was revived on November 27, 2017,
with a mix of clean-up work and some experimentation.
A year later, the code was cleaner and more portable,
but audio features largely the same. In January 2019,
the project and program was renamed to saugns
and the language to SAU (Scriptable AUdio).
</p>
<p><b>v0.3.0</b>, released in July 2019, completed the initial clean-up work.
The biggest single design change is in the scanning and parsing, new
low-level code having been spun off from the 2014 test lexer. Command-line
options are expanded and strings can be evaluated with "<tt>-e</tt>".
Various syntax details have been tweaked without changing basic capabilities.
</p>
<p>Further improvements include better audio mixing,
3 added wave types (1 removed in later <i>v0.3.x</i>,
together with crudely anti-aliasing '<tt>sqr</tt>' and
'<tt>saw</tt>'), changes and additions to value ramp curves,
and automatic downscaling of amplitude by the number of voices
(easily added as voices were already counted).
</p>
<p>Further changes were made in further <i>v0.3.x</i> versions
as a lead-up to some eventual bigger redesign.
Currently, some main ideas from 2019 remain on the
<a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns/wiki">saugns GitHub wiki</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='2020'>2020</h2>
<p>More bugfixing. Then a restart, forking off the
<a href='design.html#roots'>more simply designed</a> early 2011 version from
around the time the name changed from "mgensys". Some new ideas had begun to
echo really old ones in the design of the program. The elegance of the early
design was rediscovered, a goal set to re-expand it for a fuller feature set
with newer experience and code to draw on.
</p>
<p>New major audio features and script syntax changes were planned to go
in this new-old program, leading to some kind of saugns <i>v0.4.x</i>.
Meanwhile, it kept the oldest working name "mgensys". Noise generation
was implemented, minor syntax tweaks done, other features planned for,
and design experimented with. (This version is kept in the branch
named <tt>old-dev_202006</tt>.)
</p>
<p>But eventually I decided to bridge the gap between the elegant
new "mgensys" and the feature-preserving old "saugns" the other
way around. So the 2020 saugns <i>v0.3.x</i> versions debug and
tweak, along with bringing across changes of increasing size from
the new "mgensys" (from smaller code updates to the main new design
ideas). This is planned to become the new <i>v0.4.x</i>, once the design
and feature synthesis is completed.
</p>
<p>Maybe the overall lack of feedback (including critical) for the whole
project, as of October 2020, meant the old stable program was simply too
boring for others? Time may tell...
