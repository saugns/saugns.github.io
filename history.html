<h2 id='y2011'>2011&ndash;2012: Beginning</h2>
<p>The program was originally developed in 2011-2012. Meant to
have a "retro"-touch from the start, it was originally inspired
by the "sound" of the 16-bit video game era, particularly
Sega Genesis games and the FM synth side of the samples vs. FM divide.
</p>
<p>The design unfolded bottom-up, experimentally, into something very
compact and simple &ndash; which also applies to the scripting language.
But after a few months, and in large part arriving at
<a href='design.html#roots'>the early design</a>,
it became clearer over time that much work would be needed to make it
truly suitable for writing music in. It had only become fit for
experimenting with sound. Far greater expressiveness was hoped
for than was straightforward to arrive at.
</p>
<p>In hindsight, many changes were rushed or poorly done after
the initial design was arrived at. The first four months or so
brought most things of more lasting quality. The remaining ten
were spent breaking and unbreaking things in various ways, and
leaving extra debugging and clean-up work for later years.
</p>
<p>The program was first called "mgensys" and then renamed "sgensys".
Two sgensys versions were released in 2012 at Gna!, with OSS
system audio support and WAV file output support. Historical
versions, including other old snapshots, precede modern work in the
<a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns">git repository</a>.
</p>
<p>These historical versions never had any known users other
than the original developer.
</p>
<p>Various sketchy ideas for further development
<a href='ideas2012.html'>remain</a> from this period.
</p>
<h3 id='d2011-01-21'>2011-01-21: Quick tests</h3>
<p>The first snapshot is a quick test supporting playing the classic wave
types: sine, triangle, square, saw. The script syntax uses <code>D</code> to
set default values, <code>W</code> to insert a wait time, <code>E</code> to
wait until playing done (until end), and <code>S</code> to insert a "sound":

<p>A quick second version the same day changes to the basic wave-table
oscillator (one cycle per wave type) then kept. It also changes script
syntax towards the direction of later versions. <code>S</code> sets a
default value, <code>W</code> plays a wave, and <code>/</code> inserts a delay:
</p>

<p>"Wait nodes" were replaced by timing calculations using a delay time in each
sound-generating node, and only reaching later nodes after time for the current
node has advanced past any delay before play.
</p>
<h3 id='d2011-02-21'>2011-02-21: PM synthesis achieved</h3>
<p>On 02-13, label assignment and referencing was added to the syntax, so
that sounds can be named and then changed further after a delay.
By 02-16, scope level handling was added and a modulator list syntax,
<code>m&lt;...&gt;</code>, was added for grouping modulator sounds for carrier
sounds. (The syntax for waiting until the end of prior sounds was also
changed to <code>|</code>.) Basically correctly-sounding PM finally appeared in
the 02-21 version, along with supporting relative frequencies for modulators.

<h3 id='d2011-04-04'>2011-04-04: sgensys is the Sound GENeration SYStem</h3>
<p>AM/RM and FM support were added by 03-04, and the modulator list syntax was
also changed for PM then: <code>a!{...}</code> for AM/RM, <code>f!{...}</code>
for FM, and <code>m{...}</code> for PM. Soon after, PM syntax became
<code>p!{...}</code>.
</p>
<p>The 04-04 version changed sound generation to fill and use buffers or
"blocks", instead of re-traversing the nodes on a sample by sample basis.
</p>
<p>A joke that never took off: "sgensys is the Sound GENeration SYStem.
Throw out your fancy pre-recorded samples and replace them with terse
scripts in a primitive language invoking the powers of FM synthesis."
(Compare to "ed is the standard editor"; the only problem was/is the
young age of my program.)
</p>
<h3 id='d2011-06-04'>2011-06-04: Early feature plateau</h3>
<p>A series of quick design tweaks and feature additions led up to an early
feature plateau. A few early features were added after 06-04, but most was
completed by then, and most of what was striven for afterwards was left
unfinished.
</p>
<p>By 04-26, some fancy syntactic sugar was added in the form of the
<code>;</code>-separator that allows grouping a series of changes for the
same sound in one place in a script, even if other events in the script
alternate with some of those changes in the flow of time.
</p>
<p>By 05-08, basic support for value ramps (linear, and curves using a
polynomial chosen by ear for "exponential and logarithmic") was added. That
was just after support for writing frequencies as notes in C-major scale was
also added.
</p>
<p>A mixture of ideas were in the inconsistent syntax of early June.
The letter <code>O</code> became used for an "operator" (oscillator) in a
long-lived change. But the PM syntax was also replaced with a new scheme,
basically meant to be developed further as a new modulator syntax in general,
but then dropped and that change undone. For an oscillator, a <code>-</code>
meant "link it to what follows", flattening the PM modulator list syntax.
(A line break marked the end of nesting using one or more <code>-</code>
in the absence of other nesting characters.) Furthermore, a scope nesting
<code>&lt;...&gt;</code> syntax was meant to be combined with it,
to allow pushing/popping such scope in a more conventional way,
as in <code>&lt;-...&gt;</code> where nesting ends after the <code>&gt;</code>.
</p>
<h3 id='d2012-04-01'>2012-04-01: All the rest, then at rest</h3>
<p>All remaining syntax changes in the early versions were done by 01-23. That
snapshot added support for letting modulator oscillators either have their time
duration determined by the carrier (as earlier),
or set so as to be limited to a shorter time.
</p>
<p>WAV file output was added in the 02-10 snapshot. By 02-26, preparations to
release it at Gna! were visibly done. Further fixes and little design tweaks
mark the 03-05 release and the 04-01 release.
</p>
<h2 id='y2013'>2013&ndash;2014: Stagnation</h2>
<p>The project stagnated after a time of mostly theoretical focus.
<a href='ideas2012.html'>Old notes</a> on possible future work had
accumulated, with far more held in mind than written down about
the subtle issues and limitations of different design choices.
</p>
<p>In 2013, Linux ALSA support was added to the old program,
and some quick experimentation with redesigns in mind remain
from that year and 2014.
</p>
<p>Two 2014 snapshots in the version history capture the
sketchy outline of a lexer (meant to go along with a new
language with an undecided syntax), and before that,
incomplete ideas for an intermediate redesign of the old system.
</p>
<p>The old program design and language were seen as a dead end,
but no substantial ideas for a rewrite developed.
</p>
<h2 id='y2017'>2017&ndash;2020: Great clean-up</h2>
<p>The project was revived on November 27, 2017,
with a focus torn between three paths:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Bugfix and refactoring clean-ups.</li>
<li>Deep-going redesign with the old language and features still the basis.</li>
<li>Experimenting on and developing a new language.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these ended up given most of the focus, until early 2021.
For whatever reason, I found myself stuck moving in the other directions.
The main exception is reworking the command-line interface, and expanding
its options. Strings can be evaluated with <code>-e</code>, after using new
low-level code spun off from the 2014 test lexer to scan the script text.
Further, some smaller syntax changes made while still feeling torn on how
it should ultimately look, don't significantly extend features.
</p>
<p>In January 2019, the project and program was renamed to saugns and the
language to SAU (Scriptable AUdio). The first currently tagged version is
<i>v0.3.0</i>, released in July 2019. The clean-up work however continues
throughout v0.3.x, changes measured in lines often large between versions
while features differ little. <i>v0.3.0</i> brought better audio mixing,
3 added wave types (but 1 of them removed in <i>v0.3.3</i>, together with
adding crude rounding "anti-aliasing"
for <code>sqr</code> and <code>saw</code>),
changes and additions to value ramp curves, and automatic downscaling of
amplitude by the number of voices (easily added as voices were already
counted).
</p>
<p>Currently, some old sketchy ideas for future work remain from 2019 on the
<a href="https://github.com/saugns/saugns/wiki">saugns GitHub wiki</a>.
</p>
<h3 id='mgensys-2020-06'>2020-06 "mgensys": Almost starting over</h3>
<p>In early 2020, following more bugfixing, for half a year I forked off the
<a href='design.html#roots'>more simply designed</a> early 2011 version from
around the time the name changed from "mgensys". Some new ideas had begun to
echo really old ones in the design of the program. The elegance of the early
design was rediscovered, a goal set to re-expand it for a fuller feature set
with newer experience and code to draw on.
</p>
<p>In this new-old "mgensys" program, which did not end up becoming
saugns <i>v0.4.0</i>, noise generation was implemented, minor syntax
tweaks done, and other features planned for. (This experimental redesign
is kept in the branch named <code>old-dev_202006</code>.)
</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to bridge the feature and design gap the
other way around. Further saugns <i>v0.3.x</i> versions debug and
tweak, along with bringing across changes of increasing size from
the new "mgensys" (from smaller code updates to some design ideas).
This is planned to lead to the new <i>v0.4.x</i>, once the design
and feature synthesis is completed.
</p>
<h2 id='y2021'>2021+: Reorienting</h2>
<p>Having felt somewhat bored and aimless with the overall design,
I left it for a half a year while rethinking what's meaningful for
the program to be.
</p>
<p>A fuller and more experimental redesign may be up next... One experimental
branch uses pre-integrated wave tables followed by differentiation
in the oscillator for DPW-like box-filtering anti-aliasing for all
waveforms (including FM and PM for sine waves). But very different
designs are possible, and eventually I may abandon the wavetable approach
entirely. I remember some early ideas for more flexibly wavetype-morphing
oscillators which may make for more interesting synthesis if implemented,
and if it's made to work without terrible aliasing noise.
