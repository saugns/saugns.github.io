<h1>Platforms &amp; modifications for saugns</h1>
<p><a href='index.html#saugns'>saugns</a> is mainly developed on
x86/x86-64, because currently, such are the computers used by the
main developer. However, there's no architecture-specific code in
the program, and it reportedly works fine on Raspberry Pi 3, i.e.
ARM. Generally, little-endian 32-bit and 64-bit architectures can
work fine with the current code unless something has been missed.
</p>
<p>For big-endian, not knowing more yet, at a minimum WAV file
output code must change so that output bytes are still little-endian.
</p>
<h2>Operating systems</h2>
<p>Tested operating systems include the four major BSDs (FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly), and various GNU/Linux distros. *nix,
in general, is the easiest to further port the program to.
</p>
<p>Written in C99, the program still works on 2010-ish 32-bit x86
DragonFly with GCC 4, and other similarly old *nix systems.
